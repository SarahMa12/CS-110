This repository contains some of my mini python projects I created in my CS110 class at University of San Francisco.

## Code descriptions

### Image Operation 
Transforms images to flip, blur, rotate, grayscale, swap corners, sharpen, edge detection, and scaling larger.

### Inventory Management
Allows a user to keep track of inventory. They can add a new item, delete an item, or update an item. All of this data collected from the user is written to a csv file. Previous data is also read from the csv file.

### Shopping Cart
Asks user how many pounds of raspberries, strawberries, apples, and mangoes they want to buy. Calculates the total and asks the user to enter an amount of money. If not enough, asks user for more until they enter an amount that is enough. Calculates change that the user needs. Allows user to shop again.

### Text Analyzer
Part 1: Takes a file input from the command line and uses the text in the file to calculate the number of commas, vowels, and consonants. 
Part 2: Asks user what word to search of in the file and returns the number of times that word appears in the file.
