This repository contains some of my mini python projects I created in my CS110 class at University of San Francisco.

## Code descriptor

### Image Operation 
Transforms images to flip, blur, rotate, grayscale, swap corners, sharpen, edge detection, and scaling larger!

### Inventory Management
Allows a user to keep track of inventory. They can add a new item, delete an item, or update an item. All of this data collected from the user is written to a csv file. Previous data is also read from the csv file.
